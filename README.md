Brandon's Instructions
======================
In order to play this game, you should open up index.html in a web browser.  The game's canvas should auto-load and your character's icon will generate at the bottom-center of the canvas.  

You can move your character up, down, left, or right using the arrow keys on the keyboard.

The objective of the game is to move your character so he reaches the on-screen water without running into a giant bug.

If you collide with a giant bug, your character's position on-screen will reset to his original starting place.  If you reach the water successfully, you win and can try to reach it again.
